# Test: #0054
###### Developed by Samuel McKid

Test: #0054 is a particle based chemical and physics simulator, developed with Python and PyGame.

### Legal Information and Disclaimer
Do NOT attempt to recreate any experiments possible in this simulator. Any attempt to recreate experiments may result in damage to property and serious injury or death. Sam McKid, or other individuals or organisations involved within the development of this program, are NOT liable for any damage to property or individuals as a result of attempted recreation. The recreation of any experiments displayed in this simulator may breach laws and regulations. Check your local authorities for more information. While all attempts have been made to ensure the accuracy of the information, this simulator is NOT a reliable source of information. The simulated reactions/ experiments are NOT approved for academic study. Do not modify any files within the program. Do not distribute modified versions of this program. Distribution of original/unmodified versions may be permitted with explicit authorisation from developer(s).

### Installation requirements:

An internet connection will be required for initial install, but not for normal use.

### Installing and Launching
1. Store uncompressed directory on desktop [(found here)](https://github.com/MCSQU1D/Test_-0054)
2. Download Python and PyGame
3. Launch with the following commands entered into a command line:
4. `cd Desktop/Test_-0054-3.0` (may need to change `-3.0` to suit the version you downloaded)
5. `python3 FileA.py`


### Trouble Shooting
You will need to consult the user manual for more information, found in main directory (test_-0054)

| Problem | Possible Solutions |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Program won’t start | Make sure you entered the commands correctly in order (see Launching Application). Make sure all files and directories are uncompressed and in correct location (see Downloading and Setting up) Quit command line/terminal and restart the process (see Launching Application) Make sure all edits to .txt files are correct (see Custom Molecules and Reactions) |
| I can’t place molecules | Make sure a molecule is selected (see Selecting Molecule) |
| I place particles but nothing happens | Make sure that the simulator is not paused (see Control Buttons under Simulator Screen Controls) |
| Reactions aren’t happening | Make sure the right molecules are within proximity (see Starting Reactions) Make sure temperature is sufficient (see Starting Reactions) |
| The simulator is too laggy | Remove particles by right clicking with square cursor (see Placing and Removing Molecules) or by pressing the ‘CLR’ button or the ‘c’ key (see Simulator Screen Controls) |
